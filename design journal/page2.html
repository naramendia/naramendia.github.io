    <h2>Creative data visualization</h2>
    <p>
        The topic of this assignment was data visualization, and I chose <br>
        to take a more creative route to visualize Time. I sent surveys to my <br>
        family and friends about how they spent each hour of a certain day, <br>
        created a key and design rules, used Processing to create the grids, <br>,
        and then Illustrator to add final touches (such as the clouds).
