    <h2>Random house generator</h2>
    <p>The topic of this assignment was parametric design, and I chose <br>
    to build something that would generate a random house (when spacebar is clicked)
    <br> based on some design rules. The architecture rules are inspired by <br>
    the houses in the Spanish residential community in Port Saplaya, Valencia. </p>
